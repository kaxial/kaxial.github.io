Get Lucky - Daft Punk/Pharrell Williams
Lyrics by：Thomas Bangalter
Composed by：Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo/Neil Rogers/Thomas Bangalter/Pharrell Williams
Arranged by：Daft Punk
Produced by：Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo/Thomas Bangalter

Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning (uh)
The force of love beginning

(Look)

We've come too far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars

She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling?
If you wanna leave I'm with it (ah)

We've come too far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars

She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

(We're up all night to get)
(We're up all night to get)
(We're up all night to get)
(We're up all night to get)

(We're up all night to get)
(We're up all night to get)
(We're up all night to get)
(We're up all night to get)

(We're up all night to get, together)
(We're up all night to get (lets get funked again)
(We're up all night to get funky)
(We're up all night to get lucky)

(We're up all night to get lucky)
(We're up all night to get lucky)
(We're up all night to get lucky)
(We're up all night to get lucky)

(We're up all night to get lucky)
(We're up all night to get lucky)
(We're up all night to get lucky)
(We're up all night to get lucky)

We've come too far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars

She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

**Reasons for recommendation:** 
虽然我觉得已经火到不用我推荐了，但万一还有人没听过呢？百听不厌。
蠢朋克因此曲获得了第56届格莱美奖“年度制作”及“最佳流行组合表演”两项大奖。
就是这首歌让我入了funk的坑。
